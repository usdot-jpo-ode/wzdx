# ArrowBoard Object
The `ArrowBoard` object describes an electronic, connected arrow board ([example image](https://trafficlaneclosures.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/st4825-arrowboard.png)) which can display an arrow pattern to direct traffic. Arrow boards are often placed at the beginning of a lane closureâ€”thus knowing the location of an arrow board can assist in programmatically generating a WZDx road event with verified spatial information.

The `ArrowBoard` is a type of field device; it has a `core_details` property which contains the [FieldDeviceCoreDetails](/spec-content/objects/FieldDeviceCoreDetails.md) and exists within a [FieldDeviceFeature](/spec-content/objects/FieldDeviceFeature.md).

## Properties 
Name | Type | Description | Conformance | Notes
