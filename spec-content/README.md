# WZDx Specification Content
The WZDx specification defines the content and structure of several GeoJSON documents, each intended to be distributed as a data feed. Each GeoJSON document (colloquially "feed") contains a single feed root object. WZDx v4.2 defines the following feed objects:

- [WorkZoneFeed](/spec-content/objects/WorkZoneFeed.md): describes high-level information about work zone events ocurring on roadways (called "road events") that impact the characteristics of the roadway and involve a change from the default state (such as a lane closure). This is the original work zone data exchange feed and the only feed that WZDx defined until [version 4.0](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/wzdx/releases/tag/v4.0). It was previously named `WZDxFeed`.
- [DeviceFeed](/spec-content/objects/DeviceFeed.md): describes information (location, status, live data) about field devices deployed on the roadway in work zones.

Each feed object contains many layers of child objects. Together all the objects define the WZDx feed. All WZDx objects are located in the [objects](/spec-content/objects) subdirectory and listed in the [Objects](#objects) section of this document.

The value of certain object properties is restricted to a defined set of values called an **enumerated type**. Enumerated types are located in the [enumerated-types](/spec-content/enumerated-types) subdirectory and listed in the [Enumerated Types](#enumerated-types) section of this document.

## Objects
Each WZDx object is described by a table of properties with following columns:

- **Name** - The property name.
- **Type** - The type of data being stored. This can be one of the JSON primative types (only `String`, `Number`, `Array` are used), `Integer`, as defined in the [JSON schema validation specification section 6.1 (Draft 07)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-01#section-6.1), a formatted string as defined in [JSON schema validation specification section 7 (Draft 07)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-01#section-7.3), a [WZDx Enumerated Type](#enumerated-types), a WZDx Object, or a [GeoJSON Object](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3).
- **Description** - A description of the value of the property.
- **Conformance** - An indication of the requirement for including the property in a WZDx GeoJSON document. There are three categories of conformance:
    - *Required* - The property must be included
    - *Optional* - The property may be ommitted
    - *Conditional* - The property's inclusion depends on the inclusion or value of a separate property
- **Notes** - Additional comments, guidance, notes for future consideration, or examples.

#### Updating the object diagram
When making changes to the specification, the object diagram needs to be updated as well. To modify the object diagram, open [/images/WZDx_WorkZoneFeed_object_diagram.drawio](/images/WZDx_WorkZoneFeed_object_diagram.png) or [/images/WZDx_DeviceFeed_object_diagram.drawio](/images/WZDx_DeviceFeed_object_diagram.png)
 at https://app.diagrams.net (or any drawio editor). Make necessary changes to the diagram using the web editor, then download the `drawio` file and replace the appropriate file in the `/images` directory with the new file. Additionally **export** the diagram as a PNG, using the diagram name as the file name, and replace `/images/WZDx_WorkZoneFeed_object_diagram.png` or `/images/WZDx_DeviceFeed_object_diagram.png` with the new image file.

## Enumerated Types
Many object properties are restricted to a finite set of values defined by an enumerated type. The enumerations for each enumerated type as well as what object properties it is used by is described in its own file in the [enumerated-types](/spec-content/enumerated-types) directory.
